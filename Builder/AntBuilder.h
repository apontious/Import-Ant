 For a client with file count count, return which Ant framework index number to use for client index number.

 For example, if client index were 20 out of 1000 and Ant count were 50, we would divide 1000 by 50, leaving 20.
 So for every 20 client files, you'd use 1 Ant file.
 Divide the index by 20, you get 1, because for indexes 0-19, you'd use Ant file 0, and for files 20-39, you'd use Ant file 1.

 Number can be used as part of Ant class names, such as Ant001, or ant method names, such as ant001.
