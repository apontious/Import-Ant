/**
 Will take number, make a string for zero through that number - 1, and prepend all of them with enough zeros to be uniform in length, and for the longest numbers to have one prepending zero.

 For example, for a count of 10, the strings would be 00 through 09.

 For a count of 450, the strings would be 0000 through 0449.

 Etc.

 If count is > 999999, this method will assert.
